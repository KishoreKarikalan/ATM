Project Using Modern c++
/*                              ATM
    Data Structures Used :
        ->Stack (Transaction History)
        ->Array (To Load Card Details from File)
        ->Linked List (Track of All Transactions)
    User Defined Datatypes :
        ->Date          --struct    (Store date for validity & history)
        ->Transaction   --struct    (Stores Transaction Details)
        ->Account       --class     (Account details)
        ->Card:Account  --class     (Card Binds all the Datatypes)
    concept Used :
        ->Functors  -- Function Objects.
        ->Lambda Functions.
        ->Function pointers.
        ->Dynamic memory allocation.
        ->File operations.
        ->Inheritance.
    Concepts Learned :
        ->New way of Menu Driven Programming.
        ->UnNamed Functions OR Anonymous Function.
        ->Writting a Header File.
        ->Wide use and importance of namespace.
        ->Wide scope of Global variables.
        ->System functions are OS dependent.
